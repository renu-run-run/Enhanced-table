#  Enhanced Table

## Search:
Users can search for a specific username. This functionality filters the displayed data based on the entered search query.

## Sort:
 Users can sort the data based on the age column in ascending or descending order.

## Column Visibility: 
Users can toggle the visibility of individual columns using a modal. This allows them to customize which columns they want to see in the table.

## Export to Excel:
 Users can export the table data to an Excel file. This functionality converts the displayed data into an Excel-compatible format and allows users to download it.

## Pagination: 
If there are more than 4 users, pagination controls are displayed, allowing users to navigate through different pages of data.

## Dynamic Rendering:
 The table dynamically renders data based on user interactions such as search, sorting, and column visibility changes. This ensures that the displayed data always reflects the user's current preferences and actions.

# new RegExp(search).test(elem.name.first) || new RegExp(search).test(elem.email) 
## ( elem.name.first.includes(search)|| elem.email.includes(search))
